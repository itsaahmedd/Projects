#naive algoithim:
#genereate all possible numbers for every square and generate evry possible combination of numbers for the square until the solution works, it works for every solution however it is very slow
#in a 9 by 9 there is 9^81 possible solutions
# its is very innifeicent 


#  Back tracking 
# 1. Pick empty square 
# 2. try all numbers 
# 3. find one that works 
# 4. repeat
# 5. as soon as we find out that the solution is invalid based on what we currently have we will erase the last value and go back to the previous step and bactrack repeat it
# backtrack

# this is going to be a lot faster than trying every possible combination when using backtracking we only continue with the corrrect solutions
